Changes:
"Import" now uses a custom popup instead of the default browser prompt
Added a popup about savedata still being linked to the browser after clicking "Install as Web-App"

Fixes:
Renamed "Alpha Millionaire" to "Mighty Million", because "Millionaire" was too long to fit inside the box on Chrome on my phone
